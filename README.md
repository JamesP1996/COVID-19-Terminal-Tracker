# COVID-19-Terminal-Tracker
A Python File that scrapes [World Meters Information](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) for Covid-19 Information using Beautiful Soup 4 and Displays it in the Console.

All Information Rights belong to WorldMeters.Info and I am using them for Educational and Creative Purposes.
I made this application solely so that I could check the current statistics from my desktop by running the <b>Corona.py</b> File


## Commentry and Possible Future Update
If I update this in the future I would like to improve the speed so it's more instantanious. The Website I scrapped from has alot of other information that my scraper goes through and I am forced to go through the many div's they made.
I believe I may be able to fix this issue by getting the xpaths instead of the Div's and Class Names.
