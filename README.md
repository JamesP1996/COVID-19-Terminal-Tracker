# COVID-19-Terminal-Tracker
A Python File that scrapes [World Meters Information](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) for Covid-19 Information using Beautiful Soup 4 and Displays it in the Console.

All Information Rights belong to WorldMeters.Info and I am using them for Educational and Creative Purposes.
I made this application solely so that I could check the current statistics from my desktop by running the <b>Corona.py</b> File
